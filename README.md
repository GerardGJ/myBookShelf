# My Book Shelf

This is an AI project I am making, where the main porpuse of this project is to test with different models and try several different things

## Main Objective

The objetive of this project is to make an imge of the bookself and with this image get a JSON file with:

- Name of the book
- Name of the Author

## Ideas

Some of the ideas I'm getting at the moment is to join this with Neo4j and with the database I'm generating of different books we can build a graph with all this.

## TODO

Things to imporve, at the moment, the text recognition in the OCR only looks like it detects english, make improvements to make it detect other lenguages.
